# promote.sh — cut a Stable release by promoting nightly → main.
#
# Run this INSTEAD of clicking GitHub's "Squash & merge" on the weekly
# `nightly → main` PR. Here's why the button can't be used:
#
#   Every promotion adds a squash commit to `main` that never lands on `nightly`,
#   so the two branches don't share recent history — their merge-base is stuck far
#   back. GitHub's merge button (squash, merge, OR rebase — all three) then does a
#   3-way merge against that stale base and conflicts on every file both sides
#   touched, every single promotion.
#
# This sidesteps the 3-way merge entirely: it sets `main`'s tree to *exactly*
# `origin/nightly` as one new commit and pushes it normally. No merge, so no
# conflict; no rewind, so no force-push. `main` still gets exactly one commit per
# release, so the Stable version stays `0.<commit count on main>`. Pushing to
# `main` triggers ci.yml's release job (build + publish DMG + cask bump).
#
# Feature branches still squash-merge into `nightly` through the normal PR button —
# that never conflicts. Only this final nightly → main step uses the script.
#
#   Usage:  .github/scripts/promote.sh        # promote, with a confirmation prompt
#           .github/scripts/promote.sh --yes  # skip the prompt (non-interactive)
#
# Requires: git (and gh, optionally, to auto-close the open promotion PR).
